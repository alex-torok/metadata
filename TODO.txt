* Specifying blob patterns that metdata applies to

* Ban calling `load` on a METADATA file
* Clean up global cache to be in the parser
* Ban defining metadata in a loaded module (maybe implement a load stack?)
* Better abstraction for "what METADATA file am I in"

* Implement the meta generator to support adding common functions like "minimum_coverage" or "cool_factor" that can be imported to define metadata for those. It will handle creating a function with the boilerplate handling of file include lists/patterns
* Implement CLI interface for pulling metadata values out in json
* In meta builder function, the merge function could have a "takeMostSpecificButMergeOthersWith"
* Store file/line number definitions for where metadata values are defined in the Entry
* When defining custom metadata, define the type of the value

* Implement serial loading with import (and a simpler cycle checker)
* Implement the meta generator to support adding common functions like "minimum_coverage" or "cool_factor" that can be imported to define metadata for those
* Implement generic metadata values
* Implement CLI interface for pulling metadata values out in json
* Specifying files/patterns that metadata applies to
* In meta builder function, the merge function could have a "takeMostSpecificButMergeOthersWith"

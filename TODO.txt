* Implement a global metadata type store that can keep track of metadata types (key, horizMergeFunc, vertMergeFunc, anything else that gets passed to the "meta" function to create metadata generation functions)

== Anti Foot-gun ==
* Ban calling `load` on a METADATA file
* Ban defining metadata entries in a loaded module (maybe implement a load stack where entries can only be defined in the first layer?)
* Ban defining metadata types outside of a loaded *.meta file

== User Experience ==
* Better error messages that include file/line numbers
* Store file/line number definitions for where metadata values are defined in the Entry

== CLI ==
* "get one" command that returns a single value as json
* "get multi" that takes in a list of files and returns all values for one key.
  * Files can come from stdin if given --stdin or as args
* root command
  * --repo-root flag, otherwise default to git root
  * --verbose for logging
* Dump metadata for all files - json dump of map[file]map[key]value
* Validate tree (can we merge on every file in the git repo, globs match at least one, exact file matches exist)
* "list matching" to list files with matching value (provide value as json?)

== Correctness ==
* Freeze all incoming metadata values so that merge funcs can't change them
* When defining custom metadata, define the type of the value

== Internal Improvements ==
* In the parser, a better abstraction for "what METADATA file am I in" - thread.name won't scale
* Globbing with the full path is kinda sloppy, maybe implement a path component globber. Maybe split the glob pattern into path components, and evaluate based on each component? Not sure. Need more performance data on a larger repo.

== Performance ==
* Logging (logrus)
* Lazy Glob loading
* Parallel loading of METADATA files (thread safe metadataStore in the parser)
* Memoize horizontal merge results based on the entries being merged?
* Memoize vertical merge results based on the upper/lower values?
* Performance testing that creates a huge tree of METADATA files and runs some commands over it
* Memoize glob results when validating the whole tree
